- `templates/` Mustache templates
- `_docs/` documentation assets

## Payload sent to AI

The payload is built in `local/assign_ai/classes/assign_submission.php` and always contains
the same base fields. The only difference between grading types is which advanced grading
object is present (`rubric` or `assessment_guide`).

### Simple grading payload

```json
{
  "course_id": 12,
  "course": "Course name",
  "assignment_id": 34,
  "cmi_id": 56,
  "assignment_title": "Essay 1",
  "assignment_description": "Write about...",
  "rubric": null,
  "assessment_guide": null,
  "userid": 789,
  "student_name": "Student Name",
  "submission_assign": "Student submission text",
  "maximum_grade": 100
}
```

### Rubric grading payload

When the assignment uses a rubric, `rubric` is populated and `assessment_guide` is null.

```json
{
  "course_id": 12,
  "course": "Course name",
  "assignment_id": 34,
  "cmi_id": 56,
  "assignment_title": "Essay 1",
  "assignment_description": "Write about...",
  "rubric": {
    "title": "Rubric title",
    "description": "Rubric description",
    "criteria": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "criterion": "Thesis",
        "levels": [
          {"id": 10, "points": 5, "description": "Excellent"},
          {"id": 11, "points": 3, "description": "Good"}
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "criterion": "Evidence",
        "levels": [
          {"id": 20, "points": 5, "description": "Strong"},
          {"id": 21, "points": 3, "description": "Adequate"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "assessment_guide": null,
  "userid": 789,
  "student_name": "Student Name",
  "submission_assign": "Student submission text",
  "maximum_grade": 100
}
```

### Guide grading payload

When the assignment uses a marking guide, `assessment_guide` is populated and `rubric` is null.

```json
{
  "course_id": 12,
  "course": "Course name",
  "assignment_id": 34,
  "cmi_id": 56,
  "assignment_title": "Essay 1",
  "assignment_description": "Write about...",
  "rubric": null,
  "assessment_guide": {
    "title": "Guide title",
    "description": "Guide description",
    "criteria": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "criterion": "Thesis",
        "description_students": "What the student sees",
        "description_evaluators": "What the grader sees",
        "maximum_score": 10
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "criterion": "Evidence",
        "description_students": "Student guidance",
        "description_evaluators": "Marker guidance",
        "maximum_score": 10
      }
    ],
    "predefined_comments": [
      "Well structured",
      "Needs more evidence"
    ]
  },
  "userid": 789,
  "student_name": "Student Name",
  "submission_assign": "Student submission text",
  "maximum_grade": 100
}
```

## Expected AI responses

The AI response is stored in `local_assign_ai_pending` and used by the injector. These are
examples of the structures the plugin expects.

### Simple grading response

```json
{
  "reply": "Good work. Consider expanding your conclusion.",
  "grade": 85
}
```

### Rubric response

The plugin accepts either an array of criteria or an object with `criteria`.

```json
{
  "reply": "Solid overall performance.",
  "grade": 86,
  "rubric": {
    "criteria": [
      {
        "criterion": "Thesis",
        "levels": [
          {"points": 5, "comment": "Clear and focused thesis."}
        ]
      },
      {
        "criterion": "Evidence",
        "levels": [
          {"points": 3, "comment": "Adequate evidence, could be stronger."}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Guide response

Keys are criterion shortnames and values include `grade` and `reply`.

```json
{
  "reply": "Good effort overall.",
  "grade": 82,
  "assessment_guide": {
    "Thesis": {
      "grade": 8,
      "reply": ["Clear thesis", "Could be more specific"]
    },
    "Evidence": {
      "grade": 7,
      "reply": "Evidence is relevant but limited."
    }
  }
}
```
